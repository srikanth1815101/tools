The strings are generated client-side and are suitable for security-critical applications."},{q:"What's the maximum string length I can generate?",a:"You can generate strings up to 1000 characters in length. This should be sufficient for most use cases including API keys, tokens, and test data."},{q:"Can I use custom characters in my strings?",a:'Yes! Select "Custom Characters" as the string type and enter any characters you want to use. This is perfect for specialized requirements or specific character sets.'},{q:"What's the difference between alphanumeric and alphabetic?",a:"Alphanumeric includes both letters (A-Z, a-z) and numbers (0-9), while alphabetic only includes letters (A-Z, a-z). Choose based on your specific requirements."},{q:"Why should I exclude similar characters?",a:"Excluding similar characters (like l/1/I and 0/O) helps avoid confusion when reading or typing the strings, especially in contexts where clarity is important."},{q:"Are the generated strings truly random?",a:"Yes, our generator uses cryptographically secure random number generation algorithms to ensure true randomness. Each string is statistically independent and unpredictable."},{q:"Can I save my generated strings?",a:'The tool automatically saves your recent strings in the browser\'s local storage. You can access them in the "Recent Strings" section and copy them again if needed.'},{q:"Is this tool suitable for generating passwords?",a:"While this tool can generate random strings, we recommend using our dedicated Password Generator for creating secure passwords, as it includes additional security features and password-specific options."},{q:"Do I need to install anything to use this tool?",a:"No installation required! This is a web-based tool that works directly in your browser. Just visit the page and start generating strings immediately."},{q:"Can I use this for commercial purposes?",a:"Yes, you can use the generated strings for any purpose including commercial applications. The tool is free to use and there are no restrictions on how you use the generated strings."}]};
