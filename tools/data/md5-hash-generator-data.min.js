For new applications, use SHA-256 or bcrypt for password hashing."},{q:"What are the output formats available?",a:"The tool supports two output formats: Hexadecimal (32 characters) and Base64 encoding. Hexadecimal is the most common format for MD5 hashes."},{q:"Can I hash files with this tool?",a:"Yes, you can upload files to generate their MD5 hashes. The tool supports files up to 100MB in size."},{q:"Is my data secure when using this tool?",a:"Yes, all processing is done locally in your browser. Your data never leaves your device and is not transmitted to any server."},{q:"What is the difference between MD5 and SHA-256?",a:"MD5 produces a 128-bit hash while SHA-256 produces a 256-bit hash. SHA-256 is more secure and collision-resistant, making it the recommended choice for new applications."},{q:"How accurate are the generated hashes?",a:"The tool uses the industry-standard CryptoJS library to ensure accurate and reliable MD5 hash generation that matches other standard implementations."}]};
